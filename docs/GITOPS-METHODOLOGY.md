# GitOps Methodology for Infrastructure Deployment

This document outlines our GitOps methodology for infrastructure deployment using AWS Developer Tools and cross-account CI/CD pipelines.

## GitOps Principles

Our implementation follows these core GitOps principles:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: All infrastructure is defined as code using CloudFormation templates
2. **Version Control System (VCS) as Single Source of Truth**: GitHub repository contains the definitive state of infrastructure
3. **Pull-Based Deployments**: Changes are pulled from the repository by the CI/CD system
4. **Continuous Reconciliation**: System continuously ensures deployed state matches desired state
5. **Declarative Configuration**: Infrastructure is defined declaratively rather than imperatively

## Workflow

### 1. Infrastructure Requirements Identification

- Conduct infrastructure requirements gathering sessions with stakeholders
- Document networking, compute, storage, and security requirements
- Identify cross-account dependencies and access patterns
- Define environment-specific configurations (dev, test, prod)

### 2. Infrastructure Coding

- Develop CloudFormation templates for all infrastructure components
- Implement environment-specific parameter files
- Structure repository with clear separation of concerns:
  - `/templates` - CloudFormation templates
  - `/config` - Environment-specific configurations
  - `/scripts` - Utility scripts
  - `/docs` - Documentation

### 3. Version Control

- All infrastructure code is stored in GitHub
- Branch strategy:
  - `main` - Production-ready code
  - `develop` - Integration branch
  - Feature branches for new infrastructure components
- Pull request workflow:
  - Code review by at least one team member
  - Automated validation checks
  - Approval required before merging

### 4. Testing and Validation

- **Static Analysis**:
  - CloudFormation template validation
  - cfn-lint for linting templates
  - cfn-nag for security best practices

- **Integration Testing**:
  - Deploy to development environment
  - Verify cross-account access patterns
  - Test infrastructure functionality

- **Security Testing**:
  - IAM policy validation
  - Security group rule validation
  - Encryption configuration verification

### 5. Deployment

- **Continuous Deployment**:
  - Changes to `main` branch trigger pipeline
  - Pipeline deploys to target accounts
  - Deployment status tracked in pipeline console

- **Rollback Capability**:
  - CloudFormation stack updates with rollback on failure
  - Version control allows reverting to previous state
  - Blue/green deployments for critical infrastructure

### 6. Monitoring and Feedback

- **Deployment Monitoring**:
  - CloudWatch metrics for deployment success/failure
  - SNS notifications for deployment events
  - Pipeline visualization in AWS console

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**:
  - CloudWatch dashboards for infrastructure health
  - CloudTrail for API activity monitoring
  - Config rules for compliance monitoring

## Identity and Permissions Management

Our approach to identity and permissions management follows these principles:

1. **Least Privilege Access**:
   - IAM roles with minimal required permissions
   - Temporary credentials through role assumption
   - No long-term access keys

2. **Cross-Account Access**:
   - Defined trust relationships between accounts
   - Role-based access for cross-account operations
   - KMS key policies for cross-account encryption/decryption

3. **Separation of Duties**:
   - Pipeline account separate from target accounts
   - Different roles for different stages of deployment
   - Approval gates for production deployments

4. **Auditability**:
   - CloudTrail logging for all API calls
   - S3 access logging for artifact access
   - Version control history for all infrastructure changes

## Tools and Services

- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **CI/CD**: AWS CodePipeline
- **Build**: AWS CodeBuild
- **Deployment**: AWS CodeDeploy
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CloudFormation
- **Artifact Storage**: Amazon S3
- **Encryption**: AWS KMS
- **Monitoring**: Amazon CloudWatch
- **Logging**: AWS CloudTrail
- **Identity Management**: AWS IAM

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Infrastructure deployed consistently across all environments
- **Auditability**: Complete history of all infrastructure changes
- **Security**: Least privilege access and secure cross-account operations
- **Automation**: Reduced manual intervention and human error
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new accounts or environments
- **Reliability**: Tested infrastructure deployments with rollback capability
