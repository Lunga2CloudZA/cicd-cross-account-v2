# Statement of Work Example: GitOps Infrastructure Implementation

## Project Overview

This Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the implementation of a GitOps-based infrastructure deployment solution using AWS Developer Tools. The solution will enable the client to manage infrastructure as code across multiple AWS accounts through a centralized CI/CD pipeline.

## Scope of Work

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

1. **Infrastructure Requirements Assessment**
   - Conduct workshops to identify infrastructure requirements
   - Document current state architecture
   - Define target state architecture
   - Identify cross-account dependencies
   - Document networking requirements

2. **GitOps Strategy Development**
   - Define branching strategy
   - Establish code review process
   - Document deployment workflows
   - Define rollback procedures
   - Create testing strategy

### Phase 2: Infrastructure as Code Development

1. **CloudFormation Template Development**
   - Develop templates for central account resources
   - Develop templates for target account resources
   - Create cross-account IAM roles and policies
   - Implement KMS encryption for artifacts
   - Develop parameter files for different environments

2. **Repository Structure Setup**
   - Create GitHub repository
   - Implement branch protection rules
   - Set up pull request templates
   - Configure webhook integration
   - Document repository structure

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

1. **Central Account Setup**
   - Deploy S3 bucket for artifacts
   - Create KMS key for encryption
   - Set up GitHub connection
   - Configure IAM roles and policies
   - Implement logging and monitoring

2. **Target Account Setup**
   - Deploy cross-account IAM roles
   - Set up CodeDeploy resources
   - Configure EC2 instance profiles
   - Implement security groups and network ACLs
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms

3. **Pipeline Development**
   - Create CodePipeline configuration
   - Implement source stage with GitHub integration
   - Configure build stage with CodeBuild
   - Set up deployment stage with cross-account access
   - Implement approval gates for production deployments

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

1. **Infrastructure Testing**
   - Validate CloudFormation templates
   - Test cross-account access patterns
   - Verify encryption and security controls
   - Test rollback procedures
   - Validate monitoring and alerting

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Testing**
   - Test end-to-end deployment workflow
   - Validate branch protection rules
   - Test pull request workflow
   - Verify deployment notifications
   - Validate audit trail

### Phase 5: Knowledge Transfer and Documentation

1. **Documentation Development**
   - Create architecture documentation
   - Develop operational runbooks
   - Document troubleshooting procedures
   - Create user guides for developers
   - Document security controls

2. **Knowledge Transfer**
   - Conduct training sessions for administrators
   - Provide hands-on workshops for developers
   - Deliver presentations on GitOps methodology
   - Demonstrate deployment workflows
   - Train on monitoring and troubleshooting

## Deliverables

1. **Infrastructure as Code Artifacts**
   - CloudFormation templates for all infrastructure components
   - Parameter files for different environments
   - IAM policy documents
   - KMS key policies
   - S3 bucket policies

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**
   - CodePipeline configuration
   - GitHub connection setup
   - CodeBuild project configuration
   - CodeDeploy application and deployment group configuration
   - Cross-account role configuration

3. **Documentation**
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Deployment guide
   - Operations manual
   - Security controls documentation
   - Developer guide

4. **Training Materials**
   - Training presentations
   - Hands-on lab guides
   - Video recordings of training sessions
   - Quick reference guides
   - Troubleshooting guides

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 4 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 1 week

Total project duration: 12 weeks

## Assumptions and Prerequisites

- Client has multiple AWS accounts set up
- Client has GitHub Enterprise or GitHub.com access
- Client has administrative access to all AWS accounts
- Client will provide networking requirements and constraints
- Client will participate in requirements gathering sessions

## Success Criteria

1. Infrastructure can be deployed across multiple AWS accounts from a central pipeline
2. All infrastructure changes are tracked in version control
3. Deployments can be rolled back to previous versions
4. Security controls meet or exceed client requirements
5. Knowledge transfer enables client team to operate and extend the solution
